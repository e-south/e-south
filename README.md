ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, I'm @e-south**  
- PhD Candidate in the Dunlop Lab, part of the Biological Design Center at Boston University.  
- Previously at Imperial College London and James Madison University.

#### ðŸ“‚ Highlights

---

#### [densearrays](https://github.com/e-south/densearrays)  
A computational method for designing nucleotide sequences with densely packed DNA-protein binding sites.
- Pub in [PLOS Computational Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012276)  

---

#### [deg2tfbs](https://github.com/e-south/deg2tfbs)  
A pipeline for processing RNA-seq and proteomic datasets from *E. coli*. This tool identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conditions, maps them to associated transcription factors using RegulonDB, and retrieves their corresponding transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs).  
- **Related Repo**:  Utilizes sourced datasets (e.g., from RegulonDB, EcoCyc, and primary literature) from [dnadesign-data](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign-data).

---

#### [dnadesign](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign)  
A collection of Python modules and data analysis pipelines for studying and designing regulatory DNA elements, with an initial focus on bacterial stress promoters.
- **Related Repo**:  Utilizes sourced datasets from [dnadesign-data](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign-data).
- **Features**: Integrates tools from **densearrays** and **deg2tfbs** to drive promoter analysis and design.
