# Eric South

PhD candidate in the [Dunlop Lab](https://www.dunloplab.com) ([Biological Design Center](https://www.bu.edu/bdc/), Boston University).

I build Python tools for DNA sequence design and experimental data workflows.

Previously at Imperial College London and James Madison University.

## Current Work

### [dnadesign](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign)

A DNA sequence design workspace with modular pipelines for biological design and analysis.

- Documentation: [dnadesign docs](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign/tree/main/docs)
- Data companion repository: [dnadesign-data](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign-data)
- Integrates tools such as [dense-arrays](https://github.com/e-south/dense-arrays) and [Evo 2](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2).

### [reader](https://github.com/e-south/reader)

Command-line workbench for experimental data.

- Documentation: [reader docs](https://github.com/e-south/reader/tree/main/docs)
- Quickstart: [reader quickstart](https://github.com/e-south/reader#quickstart)
- Ingests raw instrument exports, applies transformations, and produces tidy outputs and plots for downstream pipelines.

## Research and Prior Work

### [dense-arrays](https://github.com/e-south/dense-arrays)

Method for designing DNA sequences with densely packed DNA-protein binding motifs.

- Paper: Andreani, South, Dunlop (2024), *PLOS Computational Biology*, ["Generating information-dense promoter sequences with optimal string packing"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012276)
- Package documentation: [dunloplab.gitlab.io/dense-arrays](https://dunloplab.gitlab.io/dense-arrays)

### [deg2tfbs](https://github.com/e-south/deg2tfbs)

Pipeline linking differential expression to transcription factors and candidate binding sites.

## Activity Snapshot

![GitHub Activity Radar](./assets/activity-radar.svg)

Values use a 365-day window. The radar is normalized to fixed caps: commits (1000), PRs (100), merge rate (100%), active repositories in the last 90 days (20), and active days (365). Raw values are shown in the chart legend and in [`assets/activity-metrics.json`](./assets/activity-metrics.json).

## Collaboration

Interested in collaborations on synthetic biology tooling, computational genomics, and reproducible experimental data pipelines.
