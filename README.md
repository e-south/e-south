# Eric South

PhD Candidate in the Dunlop Lab (Biological Design Center, Boston University).

I build Python-first tooling for DNA sequence design and experimental data workflows.

Previously at Imperial College London and James Madison University.

## Current Work

### [dnadesign](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign)

A DNA sequence design workspace with modular pipelines for biological design and analysis.

- Integrates tools such as [dense-arrays](https://github.com/e-south/dense-arrays) and [Evo 2](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2).
- Provides command-line workflows for repeatable sequence analysis and data processing.

### [reader](https://github.com/e-south/reader)

Command-line workbench for experimental data.

- Ingests raw instrument exports.
- Applies transformations and post-processing.
- Produces tidy outputs and plots for downstream pipelines.

## Research and Prior Work

### [dense-arrays](https://github.com/e-south/dense-arrays)

Method for designing DNA sequences with densely packed DNA-protein binding motifs.

- Published in *PLOS Computational Biology* ([doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012276](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012276)).

### [deg2tfbs](https://github.com/e-south/deg2tfbs)

Pipeline linking differential expression to transcription factors and candidate binding sites.

## Collaboration

Interested in collaborations on synthetic biology tooling, computational genomics, and reproducible experimental data pipelines.
