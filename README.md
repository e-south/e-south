Hi,

- I'm Eric J. South, a PhD Candidate in the Dunlop Lab, part of the Biological Design Center at Boston University. Prev: Imperial College London, James Madison University
- I'm an aspiring systems, synthetic, and computational biologist. I've been in the lab developing genetic circuits, high-throughput functional assays, and DNA sequence-to-expression models to steer cell physiology for synthetic biology applications.

### Projects
- [densearrays](https://github.com/e-south/densearrays): A computational method for the design of nucleotide sequences with densely packed DNA-protein binding sites, which we name the nucleotide String Packing Problem (SPP).
- [dnadesign](https://gitlab.com/ericsouth/sequencedesign): A collection of Python modules and data analysis pipelines for studying and designing regulatory DNA elements, with a focus on bacterial stress promoters.
