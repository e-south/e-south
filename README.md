### Current works

#### [dnadesign](https://github.com/e-south/dnadesign)

A DNA sequence design workspace: a modular set of bioinformatics pipelines and utilities for designing, analyzing, and managing biological data.

* Wraps packages like [densearrays](https://github.com/e-south/densearrays) and [Evo 2](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2) to support workflows.
* Provides a suite of command‑line entry points for many pipelines.

#### [reader](https://github.com/e-south/reader)

* Command-line workbench for experimental data.
* Plugin‑extensible registry that ingests raw instrument exports, applies transformations and post‑processing, and outputs tidy data and plots for downstream pipelines.

### Past works

#### [densearrays](https://github.com/e-south/densearrays)

Method for designing sequences with densely packed DNA–protein binding motifs.

* Published in *PLOS Computational Biology* ([doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012276](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012276)).

#### [deg2tfbs](https://github.com/e-south/deg2tfbs)

Links differential expression to transcription factors and their binding sites.
